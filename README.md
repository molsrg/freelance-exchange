## About The Project

I wrote a small application using Vue 3, Vuex, to track tasks on a freelance exchange. Added the ability to add, edit, delete tasks. There is also a function for changing the status of tasks. When a component is loaded, available tasks (if any) are loaded from LocalStorage. When a component is destroyed (tab closed, page reloaded), the data is also saved in LocalStorage in JSON format. This is a convenient storage for small data like mine. We plan to filter by task status and deadline date.
